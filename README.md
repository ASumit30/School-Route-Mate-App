# School Route Mate - Smart Transport Manager 

## Project Domain
SchoolRouteMate is a mobile-first SaaS solution designed for the unorganized school transport sector (private vans/autos) in India.

### The Problem 
* **Safety Anxiety:** Parents call drivers constantly for "Where are you?" updates.
* **Fuel Wastage:** Drivers visit student homes even when the student is absent because communication is manual (WhatsApp/Phone).
* **Revenue Leaks:** Drivers track fees in paper diaries and forget collection.

### The Solution 
A dual-mode App (Driver + Parent) built with **React Native (Expo)** and **Firebase**.

#### Key Features
1.  **Morning Poll:** Parents mark attendance (Yes/No) by 6:30 AM.
2.  **Smart Route:** The Driver's list automatically removes absent students.
3.  **Live Tracking:** Low-latency GPS tracking for parents.

### Tech Stack (Planned)
* **Frontend:** React Native (Expo)
* **Backend:** Firebase (Auth, Firestore/Realtime DB)
* **Maps:** Google Maps API / Mapbox
